PARKING LOT SYSTEM:

A popular machine coding round question where the intervieew is asked to design a low level design parking lot 
system. Full details regarding the question can be found at https://workat.tech/machine-coding/practice/design-parking-lot-qm6hwq4wkhp8. 
My attempt at the question, feel free to ask any question and suggestion for any improvement are always welcome.

Currently the code is supporting all the basic functionalities expected from the question, just clone the file
and run py -m parking_lot in the parking_lot directory and provide the desired inputs to check for outputs.
